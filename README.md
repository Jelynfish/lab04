Lab 04 - URLinked List and URArrayList

Unit testing method:
javac *

#this is the unit testing class, this is where the main method with the tests is. we did this so that the URLinkedList could #be used as an actual linkedlist class
#All the tests print whether or not they pass, there are 14 tests.

UnitTest.java 


SYNOPSIS:
We had to use the URNode class and URList interface to create the URLLinkedList class, essentially recreating the LinkedList class that exists in java already. We created a UnitTest class that makes sure all of the methods within our URLinkedList class function the way we intended them.
